# Voice Processing Tool

## Introduction

This is a prototypal Voice Processor written in Java, which shows as Proof of Concept the enhancement of voice samples stemming from an audio file or a microphone recording with regard to clarity, understandability and sound. Prior to the enhancement, the base frequency of the user's voice is determined by a Voice Profiler.

## How to get stared

Open a Java IDE of your choice (like [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org) or [Netbeans](https://netbeans.org)) and build the `.java` source files in the *Code* directory. Alternatively, you can also install a [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html) and execute the `.jar` files in the *Executables* folder. Please note that one sample Voice Profiling file is included in the *Executables* folder, yet you'll have to run the Voice Profiler again in order to create your own.
